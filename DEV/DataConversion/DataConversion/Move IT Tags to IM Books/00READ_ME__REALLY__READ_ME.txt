These scripts are from a task to move items from Keller's IT (tags) to IM (ISBNs and Accession Numbers)

They provided a spreadsheet with three markers on the data:  Keep (in IT), Remove (from IT) and Transfer (IT to IM)

The bulk of these scripts is the process of creating records in IM - and takes into account that they books may already be there.

Let me know if there are questions.
